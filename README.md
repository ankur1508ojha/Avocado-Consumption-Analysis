# Avocado-Consumption-Analysis
# This project aims to analyze avocado consumption patterns and explore the influence of prices on volume. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from hassavocadoboard.com, covering the years 2015 to 2021.

# Questions to Answer
Does the price have an influence on the volume of avocado sales?
Which areas consumed the most avocados from 2015 to 2021?
Is PLU4770 (Hass extra large) the most consumed variety among avocado varieties?
Does the trend in the most consuming city mirror the general trend in the United States?

# Approach and Analysis
To answer these questions, the following approach and analysis will be undertaken:

# Data Preparation: 
The downloaded data will be compiled into a single dataset. Relevant columns, including AveragePrice, TotalVolume, Year, Region, and the PLU codes (PLU4046, PLU4225, and PLU4770), will be selected for analysis.

# Statistical Analysis:
Statistical techniques such as correlation analysis will be applied to examine the relationship between avocado prices and the volume of avocados sold. This analysis will provide insights into the influence of prices on consumer behavior.

# Consumption Patterns: 
The dataset will be analyzed to identify the regions that consumed the highest volumes of avocados from 2015 to 2021. This analysis will reveal the areas with the highest avocado consumption and allow for comparisons across different regions.

# Popularity of Avocado Varieties:
The total volumes sold for each PLU code will be calculated and compared to determine the most consumed variety. This analysis will help identify whether PLU4770 (Hass extra large) is the most popular variety among consumers.

# Comparison of City Trends:
The city with the highest avocado consumption will be identified, and its volume trend over time will be analyzed. This trend will be compared to the overall trend in the United States by examining the total volume sold across all regions. Graphical visualizations will be used to facilitate comparisons and identify any similarities or differences.

# By employing statistical inference and graphical visualization techniques, this analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between avocado prices and volume, consumption patterns across regions, the popularity of different avocado varieties, and the comparison between the most consuming city and the overall trend in the United States.
